I completed my postdoc at UC Berkeley in 2022 and received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UT Austin in 2020. My research broadly focuses on human-centered AI and human-AI alignment. My goal is to develop robots and other AI systems that can safely and efficiently interact with, learn from, teach, and empower human users. My lab's research spans the areas of human-robot interaction, reward and preference learning, human-in-the-loop machine learning, and AI safety. I am interested in applications in assistive, rehab, and surgical robotics, personal AI assistants, swarm robotics, and autonomous driving.",

My primary research interests are Human-Robot Interaction, Multi-Agent RLHF, and Swarm Robotics. Currently I'm researching how machine learning can help humans understand what their robots are capable of, how we can efficiently leverage human input to teach multi-robot systems how to perform tasks, and how to share control of high-DoF robots between human teleoperators and AI. After my Ph.D., I plan to continue my research in a tenure-track faculty position at a research-focused university.",
